# Lesson 02 — Dictionaries for Security Records

## Lesson objective

Learn how Python dictionaries store related cybersecurity information
using keys and values.

This lesson demonstrates how to:

- Create a dictionary
- Read stored information
- Update an existing value
- Add new information
- Loop through a dictionary
- Make a security decision from dictionary data

---

## Python concepts

- Dictionaries
- Keys and values
- Accessing values
- Updating values
- Adding new key-value pairs
- `.items()`
- `for` loops
- `if` and `else`

---

## Cybersecurity scenario

The program stores information about a login event.

The security record includes:

- Username
- IP address
- Number of failed attempts
- Whether the device is trusted
- Investigation status
- Alert status

A real security tool may use dictionaries to organize alerts,
network connections, users, files, or investigation evidence.

## What This Lesson Demonstrates

### Creating a dictionary

```python
login_event = {
    "username": "Admin",
    "ip_address": "192.168.1.50",
    "failed_attempts": 7,
    "trusted_device": False
}
```

A dictionary stores information as key-value pairs.

```text
"username"        → "Admin"
"failed_attempts" → 7
"trusted_device"  → False
```

The key describes the information.

The value contains the actual information.

### Memory hook

```text
Dictionary key   = label on a security folder
Dictionary value = information inside the folder
```

---

### Reading dictionary values

```python
login_event["username"]
```

Python searches for the key:

```text
username
```

It returns the connected value:

```text
Admin
```

Keys must be written exactly as they appear in the dictionary.

---

### Updating an existing value

```python
login_event["failed_attempts"] = 8
```

The key already exists, so Python replaces its previous value.

```text
Before: 7
After:  8
```

This can represent another failed login attempt being recorded.

---

### Adding new information

```python
login_event["status"] = "Under investigation"
```

The key `"status"` did not previously exist.

Python adds a new key-value pair to the dictionary.

```text
status → Under investigation
```

The same bracket syntax can therefore update an existing key
or create a new one.

---

### Making a security decision

```python
if (
    login_event["failed_attempts"] >= 5
    or not login_event["trusted_device"]
):
    login_event["alert"] = True
```

Python checks two conditions:

```text
Are failed attempts greater than or equal to five?
OR
Is the device not trusted?
```

The failed attempts equal eight:

```text
8 >= 5 → True
```

The trusted-device value is:

```python
False
```

Therefore:

```python
not False
```

becomes:

```python
True
```

At least one danger condition is true, so the program adds:

```python
"alert": True
```

---

### Looping through the dictionary

```python
for key, value in login_event.items():
    print(f"{key}: {value}")
```

The `.items()` method provides both parts of every dictionary entry:

```text
key   → description
value → stored information
```

During each loop, Python places them into:

```python
key
value
```

The program then prints the complete security record.

---

## Expected output

```text
=== LOGIN EVENT ===
Username: Admin
IP address: 192.168.1.50
Failed attempts: 7
Trusted device: False

=== UPDATED SECURITY RECORD ===
username: Admin
ip_address: 192.168.1.50
failed_attempts: 8
trusted_device: False
status: Under investigation
alert: True
```

## How to run

Open a terminal inside the lesson folder and run:

```bash
python lesson.py
```

---

## Memory hooks

```text
Dictionary = labeled security record
Key        = name of the information
Value      = actual information
```

```python
dictionary["key"]
```

means:

```text
Find the value connected to this key.
```

---

## Cybersecurity connection

Dictionaries are useful for storing structured security information.

Examples include:

```python
alert = {
    "severity": "High",
    "source_ip": "10.0.0.25",
    "malware_detected": True
}
```

They allow a program to keep related evidence together instead
of storing every piece of information in separate variables.
